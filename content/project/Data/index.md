<h4 style="color: #F88379">Introduction </h4>	


<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The datathon is neither an exam or a project. Hence, there is no particular assignment. We have prepared two different data sets, around which you can develop your pitch... In your 5 minute pitch on Thursday Feb 23, 2023, bring us some insights, new ideas, conclusions and present these to the jury. Make sure your presentation stands out. Be creative, illustrate your approach and explain any assumptions you take. A nice graph speaks more than a thousand wordsâ€¦  </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> <strong> It is important to bring in your own expertise ! Engineers, mathematicians, economists, linguists, neuro-scientists, computer scientists, etc... you all have a story to tell. </strong> </p>

<h4 style="color: #F88379">Data </h4>

The data set will be released on Tuesday February 14, 2023.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> This year, the organizing team has prepared an exciting data set of some of the most famous artworks in the world. We're inviting you to delve into the life and work of renowned artists such as Rubens, Van Gogh, and Salvador Dali, and discover the connections between their artworks and those created by AI systems. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> The competition data set consists of a combination of text information on the art and artists, images, and network data. This diverse data set allows for a wide range of techniques to be applied, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced participants.
