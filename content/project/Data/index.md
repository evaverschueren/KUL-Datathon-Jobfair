<h4 style="color: #F88379">Introduction </h4>	


<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The datathon is neither an exam or a project. Hence, there is no particular assignment. We have prepared two different data sets, around which you can develop your pitch... In your 5 minute pitch on Thursday Feb 23, 2023, bring us some insights, new ideas, conclusions and present these to the jury. Make sure your presentation stands out. Be creative, illustrate your approach and explain any assumptions you take. A nice graph speaks more than a thousand wordsâ€¦  </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> <strong> It is important to bring in your own expertise ! Engineers, mathematicians, economists, linguists, neuro-scientists, computer scientists, etc... you all have a story to tell. </strong> </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>  Your team has to pick at least one of the 2 datasets. Of course if you can tackle both, be our guest. If you want to add extra data to enrich the two data sets, feel free to do so. Any tools of your choice can be used to perform the analysis. </p> 

<h4 style="color: #F88379">Data </h4>

The data sets will be released on Tuesday February 14, 2023.
