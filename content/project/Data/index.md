<h4 style="color: #F88379">Introduction </h4>	


<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The datathon is neither an exam or a project. Hence, there is no particular assignment. We have prepared one data set, around which you can develop your pitch... In your 5 minute pitch on Thursday Feb 23, 2023, bring us some insights, new ideas, conclusions and present these to the jury. Make sure your presentation stands out. Be creative, illustrate your approach and explain any assumptions you take. A nice graph speaks more than a thousand wordsâ€¦  </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> <strong> It is important to bring in your own expertise ! Engineers, mathematicians, economists, linguists, neuro-scientists, computer scientists, etc... you all have a story to tell. </strong> </p>

<h4 style="color: #F88379">Data </h4>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> The data for the KU Leuven Datathon 2023 consists of several tables related to artworks, artists, movements, academies, specializations, medium, and places. The tables contain information such as the name, description, image URL, and relationships between different concepts.  </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> In addition to the main data tables, there are also AI generated images created using Text-To-Image technology. </p>

The data is available in three different ways:

1. As a zip file stored in CVS format {{< staticref "uploads/FilesCSVFormat.zip" "newtab" >}}here.{{</staticref>}}
2. As a zip file stored in parquet.gzip format {{< staticref "uploads/FilesGZIPFormat.zip" "newtab" >}}here.{{</staticref>}}
3. Hosted online at this URL https://kuleuven-datathon-2023.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/data/{file_name}.{file_extension}. 

<p style='text-align: justify;'> A jupyter notebook file is also included in the ZIP file that provides additional information and insights into the data.</p>
