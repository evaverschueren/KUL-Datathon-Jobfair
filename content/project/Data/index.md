<h4 style="color: #F88379">Introduction </h4>	


<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The datathon is neither an exam or a project. Hence, there is no particular assignment. We have prepared one data set, around which you can develop your pitch... In your 5 minute pitch on Wednesday Feb 21, 2024, bring us some insights, new ideas, conclusions and present these to the jury. Make sure your presentation stands out. Be creative, illustrate your approach and explain any assumptions you take. A nice graph speaks more than a thousand wordsâ€¦  </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> <strong> It is important to bring in your own expertise ! Engineers, mathematicians, economists, linguists, neuro-scientists, computer scientists, etc... you all have a story to tell. </strong> </p>
