<h4 style="color: #F88379">Introduction </h4>	


<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The datathon is neither an exam or a project. Hence, there is no particular assignment. We have prepared one data set, around which you can develop your pitch... In your 5 minute pitch on Wednesday Feb 21, 2024, bring us some insights, new ideas, conclusions and present these to the jury. Make sure your presentation stands out. Be creative, illustrate your approach and explain any assumptions you take. A nice graph speaks more than a thousand words…  </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> <strong> It is important to bring in your own expertise ! Engineers, mathematicians, economists, linguists, neuro-scientists, computer scientists, etc... you all have a story to tell. </strong> </p>

<h4 style="color: #F88379">Data </h4>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> The data sets will be released on Tuesday February 13, 2024. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The data set comes from the project “From bystander to hero”, in collaboration with the emergency medicine department at UZ Gasthuisberg. New is that, after a long selection procedure, this project has reached the final of the “citizen science project” in the context of 600 Years of KU Leuven (2025). There are 3 projects in the final. The contribution of the Datathon is to optimize the location of defibrillators (AED devices). This is based on a long history of geolocation data of heart attacks that took place in Belgium. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Until November 30, everyone can vote for this project and we are of course counting on your [vote](https://www.kuleuven.be/over-kuleuven/600-jaar/citizen-science/stem)! </p>
