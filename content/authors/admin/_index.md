<p style='text-align: justify;'> On <dim style="color: #F88379"> February 23, 2023</dim>, the Leuven Statistics Research Centre organizes its yearly Datathon and Jobfair event! </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> The Datathon is a datamining competition in which teams of KU Leuven (Bachelor, Master and PhD students) work together to discover and share insights regarding a large and challenging data set. The students are organised in teams and are given a full week to work out a solution, which is pitched to the jury on the final day of the competition. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> The Jobfair gives students with an interest in Statistics and Data Science the opportunity to meet companies on the outlook for new data driven employees. Also, companies will be present that are offering internships and master's thesis subjects related to Statistics and Data Science. </p>
