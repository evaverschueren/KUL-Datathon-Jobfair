<p style='text-align: justify;'> On Wednesday <dim style="color: #F88379"> February 21, 2024</dim>, the Leuven Statistics Research Centre (LStat) organizes its yearly Datathon! </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> The Datathon is a datamining competition in which teams of KU Leuven (Bachelor, Master and PhD students) work together to discover and share insights regarding a large and challenging data set. The students are organized in teams and are given a full week to work out a solution, which is pitched to the jury on the final day of the competition. </p>

<h3 style="color: #F88379"> Why? </h3>

{{< icon name="arrow-trend-up" pack="fas">}} Because Big Data is Big Fun! 

{{< icon name="arrow-trend-up" pack="fas">}} To experience that you can achieve more as a team than as an individual.

{{< icon name="arrow-trend-up" pack="fas">}} To provide a stage for our sponsors to meet potential employees.
